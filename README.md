# Unreachable Code Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Julia code: unreachable code. The function `myfunction` contains code that will never be executed due to the earlier `return` statements. This can lead to unexpected behavior and maintenance issues.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The solution, demonstrating how to fix the issue, is found in `bugSolution.jl`.
